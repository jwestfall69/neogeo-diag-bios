### YM2610 Timer Flag Test
----

The YM2610 is attached to the Z80 and has support for 2 timers.  When a timer is
up it will trigger an interrupt (if enabled) and also set a timer bit/flag
indicating the timer is fired.

This test consists of the following

1. Setup the timer
2. Poll the timer status port for the flag to be set, indicating the timer is
fired.

When setting up the timer the diag m1 will verify the ym2610 has taken the
request by polling the busy bit of the register.  If this busy bit takes too
long to become unset it will result in the following error.

If the timer flag gets set too soon, takes too long, or never gets set, it will
trigger the following error code:
